# Menstrual Cycle Tracker

This repository demonstrates a **menstrual cycle tracker concept** with multi-month sample data.  
It showcases:

- Data processing of user notes and mood per day.
- Aggregation of mood by **cycle phase** (Menstruation, Follicular, Ovulation, Luteal).
- Visualization and comparison of multiple months.
- Expert-level Python scripting for scientific-style data handling and visualization.

**Note:** All data is **fictional**. The ideas, structure, and visualization approach are proprietary.

- Load and parse JSON input with daily user notes and mood ratings.
